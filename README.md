behat_editor_angular_frontend
=============================

This is a two part project

https://github.com/alnutile/behat_angular_frontend_core

Will be all the core features that can be used via composer as a library

Then this repo will only be the services needed for drupals particular endpoints.

Working example here http://angular.behateditor.io

Drupal front end to BehatEditor

This will be a front end to the behat_editor_services module.
This way any js front end can work outside of just Angular.js
